# SIMPLE SHELL

## The functions we will implement in the project
* `execve`- system call function(Reads through youre path which holds the environmental variables)
* `PID`(Process ID)- This are given by the computer and changes every programs ID and this helps so that each program do not conflict each others functioning
* `PPID`(Parent Process ID)- Its like when you open vi inside the shell. Shell is the parent and vi or emacs are the chid.
* `printf()`
* `getline()`(Buffer, size, STDIN)
* `strtok`(Buffer, delim)- used to tokenize(parsing) a string. The delim (splits the entier buffer into separate words.)
* `malloc`- assing pointers space.
* `free`
